# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This Python project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on three key features: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The data is synthetically generated to simulate real-world housing data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a **Linear Regression** model. The model is trained and evaluated using scikit-learn and includes visualizations for performance insights.

## ✅ Key Steps

### 1. 🔢 Data Generation
- Random synthetic data is generated for:
  - `SquareFootage`: 500–4000 sq ft
  - `Bedrooms`: 1–5
  - `Bathrooms`: 1–3
- `Price` is calculated using a linear formula with added noise to simulate realistic variation.

### 2. 🧹 Data Preparation
- The data is organized into a pandas `DataFrame`.
- Features (`X`) and target variable (`y`) are separated.

### 3. 🧪 Train-Test Split
- Dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split with `train_test_split`.

### 4. 🧠 Model Training
- A `LinearRegression` model from **scikit-learn** is trained using the training dataset.

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Predictions are made on the test dataset.
- Performance is measured using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared Score (R²)**

### 6. 📉 Visualization
- A scatter plot compares **actual vs. predicted prices**.
- A **red dashed line** represents the ideal case where predictions perfectly match actual values.
