This Python script implements a multiple linear regression model using synthetic housing data to predict house prices based on three features: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

Key Steps:
1.	Data Generation:
      o	Random data is generated for:
        	SquareFootage (500–4000 sq ft)
        	Bedrooms (1–5)
         Bathrooms (1–3)
      o	The Price is computed using a linear formula with some added noise to simulate real-world variability.

2.	Data Preparation:
      o	A pandas DataFrame is created with the generated features and target variable.
      o	The data is split into input features X and target variable y.

3.	Train-Test Split:
      o	The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80/20 split) using train_test_split.

4.	Model Training:
      o	A LinearRegression model from scikit-learn is trained on the training data.

5.	Model Evaluation:
      o	Predictions are made on the test set.
      o	The model's performance is evaluated using:
        	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        	R-squared Score (R²)

6.	Visualization:
     o	A scatter plot is created to compare actual vs. predicted prices.
     o	A red dashed line represents the ideal scenario where predicted prices match actual prices.
